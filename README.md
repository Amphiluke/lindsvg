# L-systems via lindsvg

This web application is a simple SVG-based L-system plotter and manager designed to serve as a live demonstration for the [lindsvg](https://github.com/Amphiluke/lindsvg) module which is used by the app under the hood.

There are a few L-system collections built in the app for demonstration purposes. These L-systems were gathered from various sources including the web, books, and articles. I appreciate the authors of these L-systems (you may find their names [in the app sources](src/stores/bank.mjs)).
